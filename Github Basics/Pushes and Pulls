Pushing and pulling in GitHub are two essential actions used to manage changes between your local repository (on your computer) and the remote repository (on GitHub’s servers). These actions help keep code in sync across different environments.

Pushing
Pushing is the process of sending your committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub. Once you’ve made changes to your project (like adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or editing files) and committed those changes locally, you need to push them so they appear in the GitHub repository. This makes your work accessible to others collaborating on the project, and it’s also a way to back up your code.

In short, push = upload your changes to GitHub.

Pulling
Pulling is the process of fetching the latest changes from a remote GitHub repository and merging them into your local repository. This is especially important when working with collaborators or if you’re working on the same project from multiple devices. Pulling ensures that your local repository has the most up-to-date version of the project, including any changes others have made.

In short, pull = download the latest changes from GitHub to your local machine.

Why Push and Pull are Important:
- Collaboration: These actions allow multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s changes. Pulling helps you stay updated with other people’s work, and pushing lets others see your contributions.
- Version control: Pushing and pulling help manage the versions of your project, ensuring there’s a history of changes and allowing you to revert to previous versions if necessary.
- Backup: Pushing to GitHub serves as a backup for your project, ensuring that your work is stored remotely and safe from local issues.

Together, pushing and pulling ensure smooth project development, particularly in collaborative environments.
